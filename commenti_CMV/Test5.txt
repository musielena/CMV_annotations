"I think that no matter the economic benefits (or the environmental ones for switching other fuels to NG), the environmental costs/risks of the practice are too great. Not only with the question of wastewater disposal, but concerns over triggering seismic activity, groundwater contamination, and of course the fuel cost to transport water for fracking.",

TEXT:  "1. Water that is used (and highly contaminated) is kept out in open pits before transportation away from the site. This poses a threat to wildlife living nearby (should they drink it) and there's the added eventuality of that dirty water contaminating the water table (which it will, because not even our sewers can\"t stop this 100%)

2. A second note on water, it can take up to 8 MILLION gallons per well, which all has to be shipped there via tanker truck. Not exactly efficient. That water is then made into a solution with up to 600 different chemicals (which companies aren't required to publish on a site-by-site basis, so we don't even know what's in what), and about 50-70 percent of the water is unused.

3. Air quality. Methane is a natural component in shale, so when it is cracked that methane can release to the atmosphere. Methane is four times more powerful of a greenhouse gas than CO2 is. Another thing is that the recovered water, when stored in these open pits, allows the contained chemicals to evaporate, and then disperse into the environment/your lungs.

4. By shooting a jet of pressurized water to break apart rocks we can (and have) trigger seismic activity. So...yeah. Pretty self-explanatory. (While these have been insignificant and rare, it's a situation of we're playing with fire. It's only a matter of time before something bad happens)

5. Finally, any significant success generated by fracking would take attention away from advances in truly green energy sources. Should we become content with just becoming clean*er*, we won't have the same drive to wean ourselves from total oil dependency after all",

I think you just know more about the specific waste products of the fracking process than you do about the waste products of mining other fuels. Petroleum drilling, mining and refining produces plenty of contaminated wastewater and other nasty chemical byproducts, for instance.

Also, the *number* of problematic byproducts of an energy-producing process is not the same as its *total impact*. What's worse: a process that produces a thimbleful each of contaminated wastewater, Co2, methane, and exhaust gases, or one that produces twenty million gallons of contaminated wastewater?",

TEXT:  "On one hand, I feel like there's a difference between fracking and other power forms because of how conscious we are of each. A power plant we can see and can see the smoke coming out of it, so we are more likely to demand that it be cleaner or whatnot, while fracking occurs at the oil well-not so much in our view. On the other hand, there's so many more waste products from fracking than others. For oil or coal it's simply exhaust gasses from combustion &amp; nuclear waste from nnuclear plants. Fracking has exhaust gasses from NG combustion, wastewater from the fracking, and methane release from cracking the shale (and methane is 4x worse than CO2). Don't get me wrong, I think NG is a good fuel source as a transition fuel towards full sustainability, we just need better methods.",

TEXT:  "Fracking has environmental risks and costs. Unfortunately, so does every other form of power generation. The risks of fracking must be weighed against that of those other forms of power generation, not considered in a vacuum. Oil risks oil spills and refinery explosions. Coal kills plenty of people with mine collapses and lung disease. Hydro involves the construction of massive dams that can harm local wildlife. Wind turbines require the mining and refining of rare earth elements for the magnets in them, which is quite environmentally destructive. Photovoltaic solar cells use toxic cadmium. Nuclear power risks meltdown.

No power source is entirely without risk or cost. Have you made a sober comparison of the risks of fracking compared to those of coal, oil, nuclear, etcetera, and come to the conclusion that fracking is riskier or more costly than the *worst* currently-used method of power generation? Because if it's marginally better than even *one* existing power generation method, then it ought not be banned, because we should replace the riskier/more costly method of power generation with natural gas extracted by fracking.",
