T7	Premise 2816 3220	he water shelf is only a couple hundred feet under the ground. Fracking occurs at over 10,000 ft underground by cracking open shale and retrieving the natural gas out of the pores in the shale. There are many, many layers of rock between this and the water shelf. It is impossible for anything at that depth to miraculously travel upward through these layers about 2 miles and leech into the water supply

T8	Claim 3973 4024	So why all the concern? It's due to surface spills.
T9	Premise 4025 4391	When fracking, a fluid that is usually a mix of water, sand and chemicals is pumped down the pipe to help cool the drill bit and crack open the pores in the shale. This stuff is not environmentally friendly and needs to be retrieved from the pipe once the fracking is completed. During this retrieval, sometimes the fluid spills onto the ground upon exiting the pipe

T11	Claim 6432 6500	Your sources show a pretty heavy bias and often an omission of facts
T12	Premise 6502 6693	For example, they're quick to point out how much contaminated water is used in fracking but they omit how the vast majority of it stays locked away from groundwater by a massive sheet of rock
T13	Premise 6695 6830	The Guardian for example, repeatedly fails to specify how much groundwater returns to the surface, instead using the descriptor \"much\
