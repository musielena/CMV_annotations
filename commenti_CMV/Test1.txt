TEXT:  "Hey drodin,

I work in renewable energy law and policy here in Europe. It is definitely not physically impossible for you to at least achieve close to what Sanders hopes for in 20 years (if he started in November after taking office). He would maybe have to concede (at least in the short to medium term) on natural gas and nuclear (like you said).

RE technologies are getting cheaper and better all the time, at an amazing rate. The cost would obviously be substantial but not as bad as many skeptics claim it would. 

The US has the money, labour, intellect, technology and resources to implement Sanders' plan. The only reason it is fantasy is because of the political climate in your country. That is the biggest barrier to achieving what he wants. Your original post is skeptical about the USA's capabilities but some of your comment responses are pointing out the legislative and political barriers. I think the latter is a much more valid reason to not believe it would work. 

RE production can be substantially increased in a very short amount of time. It would create jobs in R&amp;D, manufacturing, construction, maintenance, etc, etc etc... and open up a whole new field for investors. The issue is getting the political will to make such an admittedly drastic move, which I think is nearly impossible.

TL;DR - it is political fantasy, but everything that is needed to physically achieve his goal is available. ",

I work closely with a lot of scientists that are working on batteries and it would take a miracle for someone to develop the technology and manufacturing methods for cost-competitive batteries in that time. In the meantime, we would need to start laying the groundwork TODAY for the next generation grid. So that would require convincing Congress to invest trillions into a renewable energy project that depends on a scientific miracle. And even if this miracle happens, the energy bills for nearly every American will skyrocket to the point where low-income families are spending nearly half of their after-tax income on electricity. It won't happen in 20 years.",

Secondly, he has called for a ban on fracking and has stated he will not renew nuclear permits which are renewed on a 20 year basis. That means in 20 years we will have eliminated nearly 50% of current generation. That isn't a long-term approach its a heavy-handed takeover that will inevitably lead to a rise in coal generation which is by far the worst of the three.

I think anyone who is serious about reducing our emissions should embrace natural gas and nuclear not because they are perfect but because, without grid-scale storage, they are the only realistic alternatives to coal. I view Bernie's energy policy as a black-and-white political maneuver rather than a serious attempt at solving a complicated problem.",

Sure, some forms of power can fluctuate a little or require particular geographies - but that doesn't mean they are not viable.

Making our grid more reliable to handle fluctuating output and demand from different regions is a good idea regardless of the source.

It's been done.  Hard? Maybe. Fantasy? No.  The technology is there.  

Besides, setting audacious goals in this context is *fine*.  We don't have to hit the goals 100% for it to make a huge positive impact.

Also, building a dam just for the purpose of electricity is not remotely cost-effective. You need to have a reason to build the dam in the first place, then you can install some turbines to generate electricity. So building more dams solely for the purpose of power generation would not be a smart way to approach the problem.",

If we start harnessing power from all existing dams in the US it will increase the output of hydroelectric power by 16%. Right now hydro gives us about 7% of our total electricity so maxing out would increase it from 7 to 8%. Building more dams isn't really an option because the country already has too many and the efficiency of hydropower is already pretty much maxed out so increasing output from existing dams isn't an option either.",

What are you talking about? Literally no one believes this to be the case. You simply cannot use a lot of renewables, which tend to produce energy at relatively random times, and meet the energy demands of the country without being able to store some of the energy for later use. Energy storage is an essential part of the smart grid.

And his policy really isn't a long-term solution because through a ban on fracking and refusal to renew nuclear permits he plans to phase out 50% of our generation in 20 years. Obviously he can only be president for 8 of those years but you cannot tell me his approach is gradual.

TEXT:  "It's a fantasy within the realm of a four-year presidency, but that's not what he's talking about. It's a long-term goal, and a very achievable one. Renewables many generate just 6% of our energy, but there are plenty of developed Western countries already doing way better(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_Norway). 

Additionally, I'm not sure there's much evidence that grid-scale storage is needed. A lot of renewable methods of generation are somewhat geographically dependent, but there are many different kinds and they serve different geographies. So yeah, tidal power is going to be worthless to Nevada unless there's grid-scale storage...except that they have solar. And yeah, geothermal isn't going to be as useful in many places in the US as it is in (for example) Iceland, but there's hydro, wind, solar, tidal, biomass, etc. Even if we don't accomplish grid-scale storage, specifically what location in the US is there that couldn't possibly accommodate *any* of those?

In fact, there are already plans in place for every state. For example, you can check out the map here: http://thesolutionsproject.org/#page-fifty-states (prob need to click on the US and then scroll down to the state map, then you can mouseover each state to see the breakdown of local energy sources). 

Of course, that's an optimistic view of what's possible by 2050, not what's doable in the next four years. But that's what Bernie's energy policy essentially is. He's not saying we can get to 100% renewable tomorrow, he's saying that we need to start heading in that direction as quickly as possible. 

(That said, I personally disagree with him about nuclear. I would prefer renewable sources, but in the short term I'd still love to see nuclear plants replacing coal/gas plants.)",

TEXT:  "None of those things are inherently impossible. It is possible to replace the entirety of our power infrastructure over time. Naturally, it isn't going to happen in a single presidency, turning off some of the older nuclear power plants takes longer than that. That said, a lot of our power sources are there not because they are the best choice, but because we already have them in place.

We spent billions of dollars developing our coal infrastructure going back several centuries. That's an absurd amount of resources to develop coal, and all that investment makes additional investment cheaper and easier than other sources. This is called *path dependency* and isn't necessarily a good thing.

The continued use of something that's not as good because you already paid for it is something that economists refer to as *the sunk cost fallacy*. Money spent in the 1880's is irrelevant to the decision on whether or not we should invest in a coal plant or a solar plant now, but human psychology begs to differ. Ever hear someone saying how they need to continue gambling to make back their losses or saying that they lost too much to give up now? Well, that's what's going on in our power infrastructure. The math is clear *it doesn't matter* that we spent centuries investing in coal, it's not a waste as we already got our money's worth out of it, but people are still focused on all that current stuff and worried about losing all that past investment rather than making the decision based on what's best going forward.

It's getting to the point where it's hard to justify continuing building oil and coal burning plants as renewables are becoming much, much cheaper and more efficient. That trend doesn't show any sign of slowing. Building those plants and developing grid-scale energy storage is where we need to be putting our money. To not invest in those things is pure folly that will leave us behind.

It's telling that in developing nations renewables are the overwhelming majority of new construction. They don't have the path dependency or the centuries of investment in coal and oil infrastructure, but they aren't developing that infrastructure to the same degree. That makes it clear, if you clear away the natural mental hang-ups of mankind renewables already make more sense than \"traditional\" sources of power generation. We shouldn't let ourselves be bogged down by the fact that solar and wind power weren't options when our grid was first planned out.

Granted, I'm not a fan of a lot of the details in Mr. Sanders' policies, but I think that we should be investing much more heavily in modernizing our infrastructure, especially in terms of wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass.",

As of today, you are right, it's fantasy. We simply don't have the means to generate enough electricity through the means he proposed. That doesn't mean it will always be fantasy though. We've stuck with coal and oil because that's what we built our power infrastructure and cars for, so they're cheap, reliable, and easy. Nuclear is just scary to some people (idiots) so Bernie wants to cater to the scaredy-cats and do away with that too. Whatever, fine, let's go with it.

Coal and oil well eventually run out. When they do, it will suddenly be cheaper to invest in wind, solar, etc. And those technologies will improve incredibly quickly, allowing them to provide all the electricity we need. Bernie just wants to start that technological research and advancement now, rather than later.

Going back to nuclear (and climbing onto my soapbox), that's honestly the best way forward. It's clean, incredibly efficient, and we already have the technology, so far less R&amp;D money needs to go into it. The only problem is that it's scary to people who cite Three Mile Island and Chernobyl as horror stories of the dangers of nuclear energy, nevermind the fact that nobody was hurt by TMI, and Chernobyl was a trash dump run by incompetent nincompoops. Across the globe, nuclear energy provides a ludicrous amount of safe power. That's what we should be moving toward.",
